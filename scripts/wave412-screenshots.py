"""Wave 412 gate: every page of the site, at 1280 and at 390, proved light.

    STATIC_BUILD=true bun run build
    python scripts/wave412-screenshots.py

Runs entirely in one foreground process: it serves the static build inside
itself, drives Playwright against it, asserts what each shot is meant to prove,
writes the image, and exits non-zero the moment anything fails. Nothing is left
running. The pattern is scripts/wave411-screenshots.py; what is new here is
that the assertions are about COLOUR rather than about one component.

THE ASSERTIONS ARE THE POINT. The images are evidence for Callum; the numbers
are evidence for anyone who has to believe the site is light without looking at
it. Per page, per width:

  1. NO HORIZONTAL OVERFLOW. documentElement.scrollWidth <= innerWidth.
  2. THE BODY AND THE HEADER ARE LIGHT. Computed background-color of each,
     relative luminance above 0.8. A header that stayed navy is the single
     most visible way this wave could be half-done.
  3. AT MOST ONE NAVY ISLAND INSIDE <main>. `.section-dark` is the site's word
     for a plate that keeps its darkness on purpose. One is a decision; two is
     a dark site with extra steps.
  4. THE DARK-PIXEL SHARE IS UNDER 15%. Every 4th pixel of the full-page
     screenshot, relative luminance under 0.2. This is the number the
     director's complaint was actually about, and the only one here that
     measures the page as a person sees it rather than as the DOM describes it.

     IT IS MEASURED TWICE, AND THE SECOND ONE IS WHY.

     RAW is every pixel of the shot. GROUND is the same measurement with the
     rectangles of <img>, <canvas>, <svg> and `.section-dark` masked out: the
     photographs, the map's dot field, and the one navy plate rule 2 of this
     wave permits. Ground is the page's own colour, and it is what "the site
     is too dark" actually means.

     Both are asserted under 15%. On the home page the raw figure cannot be,
     and the arithmetic says so rather than a judgement:

       - the three approved hero photographs are lamplight and golden hour,
         and about 85% of their pixels are under the 0.2 line on their own;
       - the site's OWN TERRACOTTA, #c15f3c, has a relative luminance of
         0.1985, so every pixel of a brand orange card counts as dark by two
         thousandths; teal-600 (#17796f) is 0.1500 and counts too;
       - deleting the demand map island outright still leaves the page near
         17%, because removing area takes it out of the denominator as well.

     So HOME is listed in RAW_CEILING below at the figure measured at this
     wave's head, rounded up to the last digit this script prints. That is
     not the check being relaxed: the ground assertion still binds at 15%
     there, the raw figure is still asserted, and it is asserted against a
     number it can only go down from. Every other route answers to the flat
     15% on both.
  5. AXE REPORTS NO SERIOUS OR CRITICAL COLOUR-CONTRAST VIOLATION. Inverting a
     palette is exactly the operation that turns passing text into failing
     text, so this runs on every page rather than on a sample.

     AND EVERY NODE AXE RETURNS AS INCOMPLETE IS MEASURED OFF THE SHOT'S OWN
     PIXELS, and fails under its floor. A node that cannot be measured at all
     fails too, which is wave 413's change (rel412b MINOR 3): the unmeasured
     list used to be printed and tallied and never asserted, so a failing pair
     hidden inside a closed disclosure would have printed a line and passed
     the gate. It is 0 on every page, so this grandfathers nothing in.
  6. THE PAGE HAS WORDS ON IT. At least 60 characters of rendered text.
     Trivial, and it is the assertion that caught the most serious defect of
     the run: /404 was serving a BLANK PAGE, because 404.html was a copy of
     the home shell and hydrating the home route's dehydrated state against an
     unknown URL threw before the first paint. A blank page is light, has no
     dark pixels, no overflow and no contrast violations, and passes every
     other check here perfectly.

And once for the run, after the pages:

  7. ABOVE-THE-FOLD CONTENT IS NEVER UN-PAINTED. See reveal_probe(). Wave 412
     shipped a `Reveal` whose already-visible branch still carried the rise-in
     animation, and rise-in begins at opacity 0 with a backwards fill, so a
     prerendered page painted its first block, then blinked it away at
     hydration and faded it back in. The probe throttles the network so the
     gap between the server's paint and hydration is wide and real, samples
     the computed opacity of the first `Reveal` inside <main> every 16ms for
     1200ms, and fails if it ever falls back below 1 after reaching it.

`--baseline` re-runs 2, 3 and 4 as MEASUREMENTS ONLY, with nothing asserted and
no images kept, so the same code can read a build of `origin/main` and produce
the before numbers in docs/WAVE412_REPORT.md. A before number measured by
different code than the after number is not a comparison.

# Each is THE FIGURE MEASURED AT THIS HEAD, rounded up to the 0.01 of a point
# this script prints and no further. The wave 412 values, 0.240 and 0.230,
# carried 0.45 and 0.81 points of headroom against measurements of 23.55% and
# 22.19% while the docstring and the report both called them the measured
# figure; rel412 MINOR 7 was right that a ratchet with slack in it is not the
# thing it says it is.
#
# ⚠ THE HOME PAGE'S RAW FIGURE IS NOT THE SAME NUMBER TWICE, and this is the
# one place where saying "the measured figure" needs a sentence. Three runs of
# the same build at this head read 23.56%, 23.56% and 23.46% at 1280, and
# 22.19% every time at 390: the page carries running animations (the council
# marquee, the map's hub pulse, the CTA ring) and `settle()` cannot land them
# on the same frame twice. The ceiling is the HIGHEST of the readings, rounded
# up to the printed digit, because a ratchet that fails on a coin toss is
# worse than no ratchet. Lower it when the page gets lighter, not when a run
# happens to come in low.
#
# WAVE 413 MOVED BOTH HOME FIGURES, AND NEITHER IS THE PAGE GETTING DARKER.
#
# THE 390 FIGURE, 22.20% to 22.21%. The site header is 72px now and was 76px,
# because it condenses to 56px on scroll and 72 is the number that pair was
# designed around. Four pixels is nothing in itself, and the arithmetic of one
# shorter page is nothing either (four rows of white out of roughly nine
# thousand). What it moves is the SAMPLING GRID: this script reads every 4th
# pixel from y=0, so taking 4px off the top slides the whole document one full
# sample step, and every sampled row lands on different content, a different
# part of a line of text, the gap between two rules rather than a rule. Eight
# readings at this head: 22.200%, 22.202% five times, 22.205%. A spread of
# half a hundredth, and the ceiling sits just above it.
#
# THE 1280 FIGURE, 23.57% to 23.70%, AND THIS ONE IS ABOUT SPREAD RATHER THAN
# LEVEL. Eight readings of the same build on the same machine:
#
#   23.47%  23.53%  23.54%  23.55%  23.56%  23.57%  23.57%  23.64%
#
# which is 0.17 of a point between the lowest and the highest. The wave 412b
# note below already said this page cannot be read to the hundredth because it
# animates; what wave 413 changed is how much. The home page now carries FOUR
# looping animations rather than three (the council marquee, the map's node
# pulse, the CTA ring, and this wave's 6px breathing dot on the live marker)
# and a canvas that fades in over 350ms on first paint, and `settle()` cannot
# land any of them on the same frame twice. The marquee is the one that
# actually moves the number: its plates are masked out of the GROUND figure but
# not out of the RAW one, and the crests on them are dark, so where the lane
# has got to when the shutter opens is worth a tenth of a point on its own.
#
# 23.70% is 0.06 above the highest reading, which is less than a third of the
# spread. A ceiling set at the exact maximum would fail on a phase of the
# marquee rather than on a regression, and the wave 412b note below is explicit
# that that is worse than no ratchet at all.
#
# ⚠ THE GROUND FIGURE IS THE ONE THAT MEANS "THE PAGE IS LIGHT", it is 9.17% at
# its worst here, and it answers to the flat 15% with no ratchet and no
# exception. Nothing below has been relaxed about that.
#
# ── WAVE 414 MOVED BOTH FIGURES, ONE DOWN A LONG WAY AND ONE UP A LITTLE ──
#
# THE 390 FIGURE, 22.21% TO 16.85%, AND IT IS THE HERO. Below 768px the three
# hero photographs are a horizontal snap strip rather than a stack, so the
# first screen carries ONE photograph and part of a second instead of three
# and the page is 735px shorter. Three readings of this head at 390: 16.78%,
# 16.78%, 16.78%, with a spread of nothing at all. The ceiling is set at
# 16.85%, which is 0.07 of a point of headroom, and it is a RATCHET LOWERED
# by 5.36 points. A later wave may lower it again and may not raise it without
# saying why here, which is the same rule it has always carried.
#
# THE 1280 FIGURE, 23.70% TO 23.85%, AND IT IS THE PHOTOGRAPHS THEMSELVES.
# Wave 414 gave every photograph on the site responsive sources, so at 1280
# the hero band draws the 400px variant into its 392px slot rather than
# scaling the 1280px original down. The variant is a fresh WebP encode at
# quality 82 and its pixel statistics are not the original's: more of its
# pixels land under the 0.2 luminance line. Three readings of that head at
# 1280: 23.81%, 23.83%, 23.81%.
#
# ⚠ ⚠ AND THAT EXPLANATION WAS WRONG, WHICH IS WHY THE RAISE IS GONE.
#
# WAVE 414b: THE 1280 CEILING GOES BACK TO 23.70% AND THE 390 CEILING DOWN
# AGAIN TO 16.70%. The rise at 1280 was not the encoder. The responsive-image
# script wrote every variant through `image.convert("RGB")`, which DISCARDS an
# alpha channel rather than compositing it, so the brand lockup's 400w and 640w
# steps were navy and orange artwork on a SOLID BLACK RECTANGLE, in the header
# and the footer of all 36 prerendered pages at every width, and `sizes` meant
# every device picked one of them. Two black plates on every shot are dark
# pixels, and they moved the RAW figure, which masks nothing.
#
# ⚠ WAVE 415, rel414b MINOR 3: THE SENTENCE THAT WAS HERE HAD IT BACKWARDS.
# It said the plates were OUTSIDE the photograph masks and that they were
# therefore part of what the ground figure moved by. `MASKS` below is
# `querySelectorAll('img, canvas, svg, .section-dark')` and the lockup is an
# `<img>` whose rendered box the rel414b re-checker measured at 118 by 44 CSS
# px in home-390.png and 140 by 52 in home-768.png, far over the
# `width < 2 || height < 2` skip. THE PLATES WERE INSIDE THE MASKS. So the
# ground figure could not have moved by them and did not: it is SILENT about
# this defect, which is the opposite of evidence that the page was fine. The
# conclusion below is right, and it is right for that reason rather than the
# one that was written here. What actually proves the plates are gone is the
# alpha assertion in scripts/wave414-responsive-images.py and the header and
# footer luminance readings in scripts/wave414-mobile.py, both of which read
# pixels the masks do not hide.
# The rel414 re-check found the defect by looking at the pictures.
#
# With the alpha kept, four readings of this head at 1280: 23.64%, 23.65%,
# 23.56% and 23.64%, so the page is LIGHTER than the head wave 414 raised the
# ceiling for and lighter than the 413 head that ceiling came from. 23.70% is
# where it was before the raise, it is 0.05 above the highest of the four, and
# the raise is simply withdrawn rather than replaced with a new number.
#
# At 390, four readings of 16.58%, 16.58%, 16.58% and 16.58%: no spread at all.
# The ceiling comes down from 16.85% to 16.70%, a RATCHET LOWERED AGAIN, and
# with wave 414's own 5.36-point drop the figure is 5.51 points below where
# wave 413 left it.
#
# ⚠ THE PAGE IS NOT DARKER, AND THE GROUND FIGURE MOVED BOTH WAYS. With the
# photographs, the map field and the island masked out, the home page reads
# 9.16% at 1280 against 9.17% before, which went DOWN by 0.01 of a point, and
# 7.25% at 390 against 7.08% before, which went UP by 0.17.
#
# ⚠ WAVE 415, rel414b MINOR 2: THAT SENTENCE USED TO END "and it went down",
# with one figure that did and one that did not inside it. Both numbers are
# stated here now. The rise at 390 is the `max-lg:leading-[1.6]` reflow moving
# the `SAMPLE_EVERY = 4` grid the share is counted on, which wave 413's own
# note in this file says is worth hundredths of a point and which at 390 is
# worth more because the column is narrower and every line moved. NOTHING
# SHIPPED DARKER: 7.25% clears its flat 15% ceiling by 7.75 points, the ground
# answers to that 15% with no ratchet and no exception, and the raw ratchet
# went DOWN at both widths in the same pass.
#
# And the 1280 reading is far steadier than it was: the note above records a
# spread of 0.17 of a point across eight readings, and this head reads 0.09
# across four. Wave 414 moved the `lenis` wheel-momentum library behind a
# dynamic import and removed a 596KB icon chunk, so there is markedly less
# script racing the shutter.
# ── WAVE 421 RAISED THE HERO'S GROUND AND NEITHER FIGURE MOVED ────────────
#
# Callum asked on 19 September 2026 for the hero's street photograph to be
# visible and warmed through the brand orange. It went from 7 per cent under a
# white scrim to 20 per cent under a warm one; see `.hero-ground` and
# `.hero-ground-photo` in src/styles.css. THE BRIEF FOR THAT WAVE EXPECTED
# THIS RATCHET TO RISE AND INSTRUCTED THAT IT BE RE-BASELINED. IT DID NOT
# RISE, SO IT IS NOT RE-BASELINED, and this note is here instead of a new
# number because a ratchet moved without a measurement behind it is the thing
# the rel412 verdict objected to.
#
# SEVEN readings at wave 421's head, 1280, in the order they were taken:
#
#   23.56%  23.53%  23.67%  23.52%  23.53%  23.52%  23.52%
#
# and at 390, 16.57% on every one of them. Against the base `e07b7f4`, read by
# this same script on the same machine: 23.53% and 23.57% at 1280, 16.58% at
# 390. The head's median is 23.53% and the base's readings straddle it.
#
# ⚠ THE 23.67% IS AN OUTLIER AND IT IS LEFT IN, because a distribution with
# its worst reading deleted is not a distribution. It is 0.03 under the
# ceiling. The same run read the GROUND figure at 9.20%, WHICH IS THE WORST
# OF THESE SEVEN READINGS, against a median of 8.98%, so the whole page was
# darker on that shutter rather than the hero:
# the council marquee's plates are outside the ground masks, the crests on
# them are dark, and the note above already measures that at a tenth of a
# point. This page has read 23.64% and 23.65% on heads BEFORE this wave (see
# the wave 414b readings above), so 23.67% is not out of family for it.
#
# THE CEILING IS THEREFORE NOT MOVED, up or down. Raising it on one outlier
# while the median sits where the base's did would be exactly the unexplained
# ratchet move the rel412 verdict objected to, and lowering it to the median
# would make the gate fail on a phase of the marquee. The next wave to touch
# this has the seven readings above rather than a number somebody chose.
#
# It costs nothing because EVERY PIXEL THE NEW GROUND ADDS IS A LIGHT PIXEL. A
# photograph at 0.2 under a white scrim at 62 to 88 per cent cannot reach the
# 0.2 relative luminance this script counts as dark, so a page that is
# visibly warmer is not measurably darker. The GROUND figure says the same:
# 9.02% AT ITS WORST ACROSS THE THREE READINGS QUOTED IN src/styles.css,
# and 9.20% at its worst across the seven above, against 8.99% and 9.04% at
# the base. Two samples, two figures, and they are labelled here because
# this comment quoted both nine lines apart and called each one "the
# worst" (421b, rel421 MINOR 2). The flat 15% ceiling is untouched and
# unrelaxed, and the wider sample clears it by 5.80 points.
#
# Neither figure is LOWERED either. The note above records a spread of up to
# 0.17 of a point across eight readings of the same build, because the page
# animates; 0.15 of headroom at 1280 is less than that spread already.

    WAVE 415, rel414b MINOR 1's "assert on the saved image itself". This gate
    shoots full page at deviceScaleFactor 1, so a document pixel is an image
    pixel and no scaling is needed. The site is white at the top with the
    sticky bar's own artwork in it, so on every chromed route the first ink is
    the logo at about 14 CSS px. A shot whose top rows are blank is a shot with
    no bar in it, which is what a settle that photographs mid-animation
    produces, and it is the artefact nothing in THIS script could see before.

    ⚠ 415b, rel415 MINOR 9: WHAT COUNTS AS INK IS NOW TIGHTER THAN "NOT WHITE".
    The first draft asked whether any channel of any sampled pixel was under
    246, and the site's cream is `(247, 241, 230)`, whose green and blue are
    already under it. On any page whose top rows are cream rather than white
    that test returns the first row it looks at and passes with no bar on the
    screen at all: it asserted that something non-white was there, not that
    the bar was. `INK_MAX` is the fix. It asks for a pixel darker on EVERY
    channel than the darkest channel of either ground this site has (white
    `(255, 255, 255)` and cream `(247, 241, 230)`, so 230 is the number to
    beat), which cream cannot satisfy and the bar's navy logo ink `(0, 17, 43)`
    satisfies easily. Measured over all 28 shots of this gate, the deepest
    first ink moves from 10 CSS px to 14 and the pixel found changes from a
    near-white orange fringe to the mark's own arc and the nav's navy.

    It is still a test for INK rather than for the header specifically: it
    cannot tell the bar from anything else dark in the top `limit` rows. That
    is the limit of reading a picture, and it is stated here rather than
    claimed away.
