/*
 * THE DUPLICATED DOCUMENT TAIL (found by the wave 412 screenshot gate).
 *
 * The prerender sometimes writes the end of the streamed document twice: the
 * page closes properly with `</body></html>`, and then a partial second copy
 * of the hydration payload follows it. A browser hoists everything after the
 * first `</html>` back into <body>, where the payload's own text becomes a
 * VISIBLE line of JavaScript at the foot of the page and its unbreakable
 * string pushes the document wider than the viewport: /contact measured
 * scrollWidth 674 against innerWidth 390 on a phone, on `origin/main` as
 * much as on this branch.
 *
 * Nothing after the first `</html>` can be meaningful, so it is cut. This is
 * a GUARD, NOT A CURE: the bug is upstream in the prerender, it affected one
 * of the 29 pages on the build this was written against, and which page it
 * lands on may well move. If it starts affecting many, chase it there rather
 * than widening this.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT ONLY CUTS WHEN WHAT FOLLOWS LOOKS LIKE A PARTIAL TAIL (wave 412b,
 * MINOR 10 of the rel412 verdict). `indexOf` does not parse HTML: a `</html>`
 * inside a serialised script payload does not end the document to a browser
 * but does to this. So before cutting, the remainder has to look like the
 * broken second copy this exists for and not like a document in its own
 * right: no second doctype in it, no second <html> open tag, and shorter than
 * what precedes it. Anything else is left alone and named on stdout, because
 * a postbuild that silently discards most of a page is worse than the bug it
 * was written to hide.

 * THE 404 PAGE. GitHub Pages serves 404.html for any path it does not have.
 *

 * prerendered still boot the client router". It did not. The home page's
 * prerendered markup ships with the home route's dehydrated router state, and
 * hydrating that against a URL the router has never heard of throws
 * `Invariant failed` before the first paint. React then unmounts the tree and
 * the visitor is left with an EMPTY WHITE PAGE: `document.body.innerHTML` is
 * 72 characters long. That is what impactinvestmentgroup.co.uk serves today
 * for every mistyped URL and every dead inbound link, and it is what
 * `origin/main` serves too; the wave 412 screenshot gate photographed it.
 *
 * It is a static page now. No app script, so there is nothing to hydrate and
 * nothing to throw. Every route on this site is prerendered (36 of them), so
 * the shell was not buying a deep link anything in the first place.
 *
 * The markup is the SAME markup NotFoundComponent renders in
 * src/routes/__root.tsx, word for word and class for class, so the strings
 * stay the owner's and every utility used here is already in the stylesheet
 * because that component uses it. If you change the component, change this.
