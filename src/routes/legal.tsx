/**
 * /legal, the company block the footer's `Legal` link opens.
 *
 * A PAGE, NOT A PANEL, and the reason is the build: this site prerenders to
 * static HTML for GitHub Pages, so a page is a real URL a council, a solicitor
 * or a reader can bookmark, quote in a complaint and reach with JavaScript
 * off. A disclosure panel that only exists once React has hydrated is a
 * disclosure that some readers do not get. It is added to the prerender list
 * in `vite.config.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠ AND TO `sitemap[.]xml.ts`, WHICH DOES NOT CURRENTLY SHIP. That route is a
 * server handler, and the static build sets `nitro: false`, so no sitemap.xml
 * is emitted at all and `robots.txt` names none. Its `BASE_URL` is also still
 * "", so every `<loc>` would be relative and invalid if it did ship. That is a
 * pre-existing defect, not this wave's, and the entry is added so that /legal
 * is in it the day somebody fixes the route. See the wave 298 report.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY VALUE ON THIS PAGE COMES FROM A REGISTER, NOT FROM COPY.
 * The company fields are read off Companies House (see content/legal.ts for
 * the source URL, the date it was read and the note on how the register splits
 * the address); the ICO and PRS references and the insurance position come
 * from `trustRegistrations`, which the footer already prints. Nothing here may
 * be softened, rounded or filled in with a placeholder: if a value cannot be
 * evidenced it is left off the page and raised in the wave report instead.
 *
 * ⚠ NO CLAIM OF AUTHORISATION OR EXEMPTION belongs on this page. The company's
 * regulatory position is stated once, in the footer notice, and it says what
 * the company is NOT. Listing registrations is not the same as claiming a
 * regulator has approved anything, and this page must never read as if it is.
 */

/*
 * ⚠ TITLED AFTER THE COMPANY, NOT AFTER THE PRODUCT, AND ALONE ON THE SITE IN
 * THAT. Every other page ends "The Impact Investment Platform". This is the
 * one page whose whole job is to establish that the legal entity is Impact
 * Investment Group UK Limited, and titling it after the platform reintroduces
 * exactly the company-versus-platform ambiguity the review raised. The
 * separator is a middot rather than the dash the other titles use because this
 * project's canon forbids the em dash in anything newly written.

 * meaningful as absolute URLs: `/legal` in a `rel="canonical"` is resolved
 * against whatever origin happens to be serving the markup, so a preview

 * `og:url` is read out of context by crawlers that have no base to resolve
 * against at all.
 *
 * The origin is this repo's `public/CNAME`, which is what GitHub Pages serves
 * from. If the domain moves, that file and this constant move together.
 *
 * Every other route on this site still emits root-relative values here. That
 * is the same defect and it is not this wave's to fix; a small follow-up
 * should lift this constant somewhere shared and use it everywhere.
