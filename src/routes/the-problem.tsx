 * /the-problem — four sections and the shared close.

 *   1 · The scale             navy    1.34m      Petra
 *   2 · The cost of waiting   cream   £2.7bn     — no character, deliberately
 *   3 · Why it stays broken   navy    5          Peter
 *   4 · The opportunity       cream   £39bn      Pippa
 *   5 · Close                 navy    the same CTA as /about and /platform
 *
 * ── THE LAYOUT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One enormous number on the left, the data as rows on the right, and the
 * character OVERSIZED AND BLEEDING OFF THE OUTER EDGE of the page — left on
 * sections one and three, right on section four. Three things about that:
 *
 *   · The bleed is the point. A figure fully inside the container reads as
 *     clip-art dropped onto the page; one that runs off the edge reads as part
 *     of it. That is why the section is `overflow-hidden` and the image is
 *     positioned at a negative offset rather than being given a column.
 *   · Alternating sides gives the page a rhythm — the eye zig-zags down rather
 *     than running straight — which is the whole reason this beat the
 *     centred-gutter version.
 *   · They are gone below lg. At tablet width the bleed eats the copy, and a
 *     shrunk character is worse than none. `hidden lg:block`, no apology.
 *
 * ── WHAT CAME OFF THIS PAGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DEMAND MAP WAS HERE AND IS NOT ANY MORE. The page used to run a
 * hero, a live-counters band and the full interactive DemandMap. The brief was
 * four sections, and the map did not earn one of them: it answers "where", and
 * this page now answers "how big, what it costs, why, and what is funded".
 *
 * It is NOT lost — `<DemandMap readout="overlay" />` still runs on the
 * homepage, which is the only place it was ever the main event. If it is ever
 * wanted back here it is one import and one line.
 *
 * The live-counters band went with it. Those three figures are the platform's
 * own numbers, and this page is deliberately built from published statistics
 * that anyone can check — mixing our counters in among gov.uk releases would
 * borrow authority the counters have not earned yet.
