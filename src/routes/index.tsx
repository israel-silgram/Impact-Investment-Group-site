          between the mission panel and the demand map because that is the
          hinge in the argument: this is who is asking, immediately before the
          map showing where.

          Now an anchored panel rather than a loose strip. The count, the
          "of ~296" denominator and the disclaimer live in a fixed label block
          inside the component, so the compliance text is structural instead of
          a caption that a later layout pass would trim. See CouncilPanel. */}

      {/* 3 · Live UK demand map — stays dark, the glow needs it.

          Option A of four: the map moves right and roughly doubles, and
          everything that used to sit under the statements comes out.

          What was removed was dead UI, not features. The ten category chips
          were <li> elements with no handler and were never passed to
          <DemandMap visibleIds>; both dropdowns carried options and no
          onChange. Hover, click, selection and the readout all live inside
          DemandMap and are untouched by this.

          Two disclaimers were under there. The commissioning-briefs one was a
          straight duplicate of what CouncilPanel now states in full beside the
          crests, so it is deleted — see the note in content/home.ts. The
          illustrative-purposes one is NOT tied to the dropdowns: the map still
          shows illustrative data, so it survives as one line behind an info
          icon in the left column.

          The map column is capped in WIDTH because the SVG scales off its
          620 × 760 viewBox — width is the only thing that controls its height.
          560px puts it at ~686px tall, which is roughly the height of the left
          column beside it, so the two balance. */}
