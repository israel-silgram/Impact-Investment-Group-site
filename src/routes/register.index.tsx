/**
 * /register — the picker.
 *
 * R295-3: the heading, one line of lede, and the ten tiles. Nothing else is on
 * this page and nothing else should be added to it. A chooser earns its keep
 * by being unambiguous, and every extra thing on it is another reason to stop
 * and think rather than click.
 *
 * There is no orange action here on purpose. The ten tiles ARE the action, and
 * a primary button beside them would be an eleventh choice competing with the
 * ten. The site's one-orange-action rule is satisfied by the header button,
 * which is chrome and sits outside the count.
