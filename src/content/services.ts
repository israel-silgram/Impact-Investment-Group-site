 * ── FIND IT · PRICE IT · PROVE IT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This section used to be SIX things: three tools in a row, and inside the
 * third one, three analysts. A reader met six items and had to work out how
 * they related to each other before any of it meant anything.
 *
 * Petra, Peter and Pippa already are find / price / prove, so the two lists
 * collapsed into one. Three steps, three faces, and the tool each one works in
 * named on a chip beside it. Roughly 120 words became 45.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CHIPS NAME A TOOL OR A PROPERTY, NOT A CLAIM ABOUT THE ANALYST.
 * Pippa's chip is "Impact score" and NOT "Demand Map" — the Demand Map is a
 * tool the visitor uses, not something she runs, and saying otherwise would
 * misdescribe the product. The Demand Map keeps its own line under the trio
 * (`workflowFooter`) for exactly that reason. If either is ever edited, keep
 * that separation.
