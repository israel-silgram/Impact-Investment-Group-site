/**
 * /the-problem — the four sections, and every figure on them.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAY GO ON THIS PAGE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Published statistics only. Every entry below carries `source` and, where the
 * publisher gives one, a date. A figure without both does not ship.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO MARKET SIZING. An earlier draft of this page carried indicative asset
 * values (£425bn for the whole backlog, £4.25bn for a 1% share) and a market-
 * penetration table. All of it was cut at Callum's decision and none of it may
 * come back. Two reasons, and the second is the important one:
 *
 *   1. Those numbers are arithmetic, not statistics — a count multiplied by an
 *      average house price. They have no publisher.
 *   2. They are forward-looking financial projections on a public page, from a
 *      company that is NOT authorised or regulated by the FCA. That is the
 *      single riskiest thing that could sit here.
 *
 * They belong in the investor deck. They do not belong on the open web.
 *
 * Three further figures were offered and rejected for this page:
 *   · "19 million retail investors"     — no source given
 *   · "2.3–2.8 million landlords"       — a range of estimates, no single publisher
 *   · "400,000–430,000 homes per year"  — contested; the government target is
 *                                         300,000 and other bodies say 340,000,
 *                                         so it cannot be stated as a fact
 *
 * ── THE ONE FIGURE HERE THAT IS NOT A GOVERNMENT RELEASE ─────────────────
 *
 * The £102m NHS cost is sourced to Inside Housing — trade press reporting on a
 * figure, rather than the figure's publisher. Everything around it is gov.uk.
 * It is flagged rather than removed because the claim is real and useful, but
 * if a primary source cannot be found it should come off rather than sit in a
 * row of government statistics borrowing their authority.
