 * hunt for it is not.
 *
 * It used to read, in full:
 *
 *   "UK GDPR · we use your details only to answer this enquiry · ICO ZB957755"
 *
 * which named no controller, gave no way to reach one, and linked to nothing.
 * The parts below add those three things and change the promise in none of
 * them: the purpose is still the same purpose, word for word.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS FORM SENDS NO MARKETING, SO IT ASKS FOR NO MARKETING CONSENT.
 * Do not add a marketing checkbox here. If marketing is ever switched on, the
 * consent is collected then, unticked, and this notice changes with it. And
 * never pre-tick a box on this form: a pre-ticked box is not a consent under
 * UK GDPR, so it would buy nothing and cost the page its credibility.

 * The three things that stop somebody hitting send.
 *
 * This is not decoration and it is not marketing. The reason a form goes
 * unfilled is almost never the layout — it is not knowing where it goes, how
 * long it takes and what happens afterwards. These sit beside the submit
 * button because that is the moment the doubt occurs.
 *
 * ⚠️ EACH LINE IS A PROMISE THE BUSINESS HAS TO KEEP. "A person reads it" and
 * "no automated sequence" are commitments about how enquiries are handled. If
 * an autoresponder or a drip campaign is ever switched on, these come off the
 * page the same day — a broken promise here is worse than no promise.
 *
 * The reply times must match the `reply` values on `enquiryRoutes` above. If
 * one changes, change both.
