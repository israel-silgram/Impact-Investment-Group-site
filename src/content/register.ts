/**
 * THE WAIT LIST: every string and every question, typed.
 *
 * Wave 295. The site used to send all ten role tiles and the header button to
 * /contact with `enquiry=waitlist` preselected, which asked a landlord and a
 * local authority the same four questions and learned nothing from either. The
 * wait list now has its own two routes:
 *
 *   /register          the picker: the same ten roles, the same icons
 *   /register/<id>     one page per role, asking that role its own questions
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING IN HERE IS DECORATION. Every answer is a row the platform will be
 * built against: which regions to open first, which frictions to solve first,
 * what a licence can be priced at. A question nobody will act on costs a real
 * sign-up, because every question is another chance to close the tab. Three to
 * six per role, and each one has to earn its place.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE QUESTION IDS ARE A WIRE CONTRACT. They are the keys of the `answers`
 * object posted to the platform backend and stored there. They are snake_case,
 * they are stable, and renaming one orphans every answer already recorded
 * against the old name. Add freely; rename never.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO FIGURE ON THESE PAGES. The site's rule is that a number is either
 * sourced or absent, and a conversion page is exactly where an unsourced one
 * would be most tempting and most damaging: these readers buy from councils.
 * There is no statistic, no testimonial and no promise of a return anywhere in
 * this file, and none may be added without a source and Callum's sign-off.
 *
 * The copy here was written for Callum to read before it goes live and is
 * reproduced verbatim in docs/WAVE295_REPORT.md.
