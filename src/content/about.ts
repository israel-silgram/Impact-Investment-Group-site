 *
 *   Who We Are ......... the director and the team context
 *   Why We Exist ....... the vision and mission cards
 *   What We Do ......... the group structure, partner types, technology
 *                        partners and the commissioning context
 *   Why Partner ........ the values, how a partnership starts, what we ask
 *
 * The previous hero statement is retired but kept, because it is the sharpest
 * sentence written for this page and may be wanted again:
 *
 *   "Somebody is waiting in a hospital bed, a hostel or a placement that was
 *    never right for them — not because the money is missing, but because
 *    nobody joined the home, the lease and the support together. That is the
 *    work we do."

 * Names, roles and credential lines are the client's, transcribed from the
 * existing production site. Two deliberate changes, both easy to reverse:
 *
 *  1. Honorifics dropped — "Miss Maria Avallone" became "Maria Avallone".
 *     "Miss" states a woman's marital status where the men's titles state
 *     nothing, which reads dated on an investor-facing page. "Dr" is kept: it
 *     is a professional qualification, not a courtesy title.
 *  2. "$100 million in raises" is kept exactly as supplied, but it is a DOLLAR
 *     figure on a UK site quoting UK charitable fundraising. Worth confirming
 *     with Jonathan whether it should read £ — it is the only currency on the
 *     page and a reader will notice.
 *
 * PORTRAITS. Supplied as 4096 × 4096 PNGs, already cut to a circle on a
 * transparent ground and already black and white. Each was trimmed to its alpha
 * bounds — otherwise the transparent margin would shrink the face inside the
 * ring — squared, resized to 400px and saved as WebP with its alpha intact.
 * 11.8 MB of PNG became 62 KB. The initials fallback in DirectorCard stays in
 * place for anyone added later without a photograph.
 *
 * Israel leads: his card is full width above the other four, at a larger size,
 * with the only orange accent on the page. That is the "big dog" treatment,
 * done with hierarchy rather than by shrinking anyone else.
