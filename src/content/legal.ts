/**
 * THE COMPANY RECORD, AND WHERE THE POLICIES LIVE.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY VALUE IN `companyRecord` IS COPIED FROM THE COMPANIES HOUSE PUBLIC
 * REGISTER. Nothing here may be typed from memory, inferred from a domain
 * name, or filled with a placeholder. If a field cannot be evidenced it is
 * omitted from the page and raised as an outstanding question in the wave
 * report, because a wrong company number on a legal page is worse than a
 * missing one.
 *
 *   Source:    https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16650494
 *              and its filing history, form AD01 filed 29 May 2026
 *   Read on:   9 September 2026 (wave 298)
 *
 * ON THE REGISTERED OFFICE. There are THREE strings in play and it is worth a
 * minute to know which is which.
 *
 * 1. WHAT THE COMPANY ACTUALLY FILED. The AD01 of 29 May 2026 prints the
 *    address as one unbroken line, with no field splitting and no punctuation:
 *
 *      "Renewal Trust Business Centre 3 Hawksworth St Nottingham NG3 2EG"
 *
 *    This is the best evidence there is, and `registeredOfficeAsFiled` holds
 *    it. Note "St", not "Street".
 *
 * 2. WHAT THE COMPANY PROFILE PAGE SHOWS. The same address, reassembled from
 *    separate fields, with Companies House's own comma landing mid-name:
 *
 *      "Renewal Trust Business, Centre 3 Hawksworth St, Nottingham, NG3 2EG"
 *
 *    The premises field is "Renewal Trust Business" and the first address line
 *    is "Centre 3 Hawksworth St". `registeredOfficeAsRegistered` holds it, and
 *    the AD01 is what proves the split is an artefact rather than the name.
 *
 * 3. WHAT THIS SITE PRINTS. `registeredOffice`, accepted by Callum on
 *    9 September 2026 (wave 298, question O-4). Against the FILED form it makes
 *    one substantive change and adds punctuation the filing does not carry:
 *
 *      "St" is expanded to "Street"
 *      commas are inserted after "Centre" and after "Nottingham"
 *
 * ⚠ THAT EXPANSION IS A DECISION, NOT A LICENCE, AND WAVE 297 DOES NOT MAKE
 * IT. The platform prints "3 Hawksworth St", following the AD01 exactly, so
 * the two properties currently disclose the same registered office in two
 * different forms. One of them should move before both land, and it is a
 * one-line edit either way. Callum's call; see the wave 298 report, O-4.
 *
 * An earlier draft of this file made the same edits while describing the
 * change as comma-only, which is how a small improvement quietly becomes an
 * unverified claim. Any further departure needs Callum again. The cleanest fix
 * of all is to correct the premises field at Companies House, after which the
 * profile page, the filing and the site all read the same.
