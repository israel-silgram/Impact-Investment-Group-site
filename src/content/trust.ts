/**
 * The 18 councils whose published commissioning briefs shape what the
 * platform sources. Every entry has artwork — a council without a logo is
 * left out rather than shown as bare text.
 *
 * ARTWORK: these point at `councils/normalised/`, not at the original
 * `-128.webp` files beside them. The originals are inconsistent in a way no
 * amount of CSS could fix: ten carry a white background baked in, four are
 * properly transparent, and Liverpool and Salford are white-out-of-colour
 * lockups — a purple block and a pink block. Aspect ratios ran from 1:1
 * (Manchester) to 4:1 (Newcastle), so a row of equal-width plates still
 * looked ragged, because each file brought its own padding with it.
 *
 * They render in FULL COLOUR — the earlier low-saturation treatment is gone.
 * That is what the normalisation is carrying now: the row reads as one rhythm
 * because every mark is the same optical size, not because the colour was
 * drained out of it.
 *
 * The normalised set is generated from those originals: flattened onto white,
 * trimmed of the file's own padding, then rescaled so every mark occupies the
 * same optical AREA — sqrt(w × h) held constant — and centred in a 240 × 104
 * canvas. A square crest and a wide wordmark therefore carry equal visual
 * weight in the lane. No mark is cropped, recoloured or distorted; only the
 * empty space around it changes.
 *
 * The originals are deliberately kept in place. If a council reissues its
 * mark, replace the original and regenerate — do not hand-edit the normalised
 * file.
 *
 * This also rules out the treatment that would suit the navy best — logos
 * knocked back to white with no plates. Liverpool and Salford would come
 * through as solid rectangles, because in their artwork the colour IS the
 * background. That needs reversed-out versions from the councils themselves.
