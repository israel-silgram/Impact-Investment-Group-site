/**
 * Footer, halved and then tightened again (~980px → ~500px → ~430px).
 *
 * Nothing has ever been removed from it. Every link, every crisis number,
 * every registration reference and the legal notice are all still here,
 * verbatim. All of the height has come out of spacing and type scale:
 *
 *  - Padding 56/80px → 32/40px → 28/32px, and the three bands became two.
 *  - Link rows lost the 44px minimum on desktop (they keep it on touch, where
 *    it matters) and sit at 13px with 2px between them — ~25px each, still
 *    clear of the 24px target-size minimum. Do not tighten this further.
 *  - The registrations band used to be its own full-width strip with its own
 *    rule. It now sits under the columns as three compact cards, and the
 *    verify link runs inline on the reference line rather than taking a row
 *    of its own — which is what took the last ~20px out of the tallest card.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO RULE BETWEEN THE COLUMNS AND THE REGISTRATIONS. Removed at Callum's
 * request. The two blocks are now separated by whitespace alone, which is why
 * the top block's bottom padding is deliberately smaller than its top padding
 * — the gap between them IS the separator, so it has to stay a single, even
 * space. If you re-pad this symmetrically the two blocks will look welded
 * together.

       * THE ARCH. A dome across the top of the footer, so the register funnel
       * and the footer read as one block rising out of the page rather than as
       * two more stacked bands.
       *
       * ⚠ A CURVED DIVIDER HAS TWO COLOURS AND THEY ARE NOT FREE: ITS
       * BACKGROUND MUST BE THE COLOUR OF THE SECTION ABOVE IT AND ITS SHAPE
       * MUST BE THE COLOUR OF THE SECTION BELOW IT. Anything else paints a
       * strip of a third colour across the page. Written here because the
       * next person to change a band's colour will otherwise break this
       * again, which is exactly how it broke the first time.
       *
       * WHAT BROKE. This strip was transparent with a CREAM dome in it, which
       * was correct while every route ended on a white section: white showed
       * in the two top corners, cream in the middle, cream below. Wave 412
       * made five routes end on the cream band instead, and on those the
       * corners showed the WHITE PAGE between two cream bands. That is the
       * "broken white part" in Callum's screenshot of 19 September.
       *
       * HOW IT IS FIXED, and it is fixed structurally rather than by naming a
       * second colour: `.footer-arch` pulls the strip up over the section
       * above it by exactly its own height, so the transparent corners show
       * that section's own ground on every route, whatever it is, with
       * nothing to keep in step. The dome is the FOOTER'S ground, and the
       * footer is white (R421-1).
       *
       * THE HAIRLINE IS NOT DECORATION. Eight of the thirteen routes end on a
       * white section, and there a white dome on a white ground is a curve
       * nobody can see. The 1px `border-rule` stroke is the same hairline the
       * site rules every other section boundary with, so the footer still
       * reads as its own section on every route; on the five cream-ending
       * ones the colour sweep carries it as well. `non-scaling-stroke`
       * because `preserveAspectRatio="none"` stretches this path to any width
       * and would otherwise stretch its stroke with it.
       *
       * ⚠ THE CONTROL POINTS ARE y=-44 AND THEY USED TO BE y=-47. For a cubic
       * from (0,140) to (1440,140) the apex is at (140 + 3a + 3a + 140) / 8,
       * so -47 puts it at y=-0.25: a QUARTER OF A UNIT ABOVE the top of the
       * viewBox. With the fill alone that was invisible, since there was
       * nothing above the edge to lose. With a 1px `non-scaling-stroke`
       * centred on the path it is not: the stroke's upper half was clipped by
       * the strip's `overflow-hidden` across the middle of the arc, and on
       * the eight routes that end white this hairline is the whole boundary,
       * so the thinnest part of it was the middle. -44 puts the apex at y=+2,
       * about one device pixel below the edge at every width this strip
       * takes, which is inside the clip and still reads as an apex on the
       * edge rather than as a wave. BOTH PATHS CARRY THE SAME NUMBER so the
       * stroke stays on the fill's own edge.
       *
       * The second path is the same curve without the closing `Z`, so the
       * stroke draws the arc alone and not the straight bottom edge a closed
       * path would add.
       *
       * -mb-px hides the hairline seam between the strip and the footer body.

       * way out and the operator chose white, because wave 412 declared
       * exactly TWO navy islands on this site and a navy footer would be a
       * third and the largest block on the page, undoing on the last screen

              Phone rule 4 names this card: "the crisis card comes first in
              the footer". Below 1024px these five columns stack in markup
              order and the crisis card was LAST, under the company
              description, the six site links, the six contact routes and the
              ten partner pages. On a 390px screen that is most of a thousand
              pixels of scroll between a person in trouble and three telephone
              numbers, on the one block of this site that exists for them.

              Moved in the MARKUP rather than with `order`, because `order`
              moves the paint and leaves the reading order, the tab order and
              the screen reader where they were. Desktop is placed back in the
              fifth column with explicit grid coordinates, so nothing at
              1024px and above moves; what changes there is that the card now
              comes first for a keyboard as well, which for this card is not a
              regression.

              The block below is otherwise untouched, including every word of
              wave 412's note about why it is a navy island. */}

              WAVE 412 MADE THIS A NAVY ISLAND AND SAID SO. It was already
              painted navy by hand, with arbitrary `bg-[var(--color-navy-900)]`
              values chosen precisely because they do not match the
              `bg-navy-*` substring the light remap looks for. That worked and
              it was a trick. The card now carries `section-dark`, which is the
              site's word for "this plate stays dark on purpose", so the wave
              412 screenshot gate can count the islands on a page and fail if
              a third one appears. `data-accent="teal"` keeps the teal rule
              that the island rule would otherwise paint navy.

              It earns the darkness: this is the one block on the page a
              person in trouble has to find, and on a cream footer nothing
              else would separate from it. It sits in the FOOTER, outside
              <main>, so it does not spend the one island a route is

           * THE LEGAL LINKS. Four text links, present on every route because
           * this footer is drawn by __root.tsx. Three are the company's
           * published documents on the platform (this site has none of its
           * own); `Legal` is the company block on this site, at /legal.
           *
           * They sit ABOVE the notice, not inside it: a link buried in an
           * 11px grey paragraph is the "technically present" that the CMA
           * guidance on misleading omissions is about. 13px, 44px targets on
           * touch, and they wrap to a second line at 360 rather than
           * scrolling sideways.
           *
           * ⚠ THEY USED TO RESOLVE TO NAVY BY ACCIDENT, and wave 412 made
           * that deliberate. The classes were `text-mist hover:text-white`,
           * and the unlayered remap matched the `text-white` substring at ALL
           * times rather than only on hover, so the links rendered navy-900
           * whatever state they were in and the hover did nothing. They are
           * now `text-ink-muted` (6.20:1 on the cream) with a real
           * `hover:text-orange-700` (5.78:1), so the hover state is a state
           * again. The underline carries the affordance either way.
           *
           * ⚠ THE ORDER IS FIXED and matches the platform's own footer:
           * Terms, Privacy, Disclaimer, Legal. Do not reorder or drop one to
           * save a line. (Wave 298, R298-1.)
           *
           * ⚠ THE REGION IS "Legal and policies", NOT "Legal". One of the
           * links inside it is called Legal, and a nav with the same
           * accessible name announces as "Legal, navigation" immediately
           * before "Legal, link", which gives a screen-reader user no way to
           * tell the container from its contents. The wave 298 gate asserts
           * this exact string on every prerendered page.
