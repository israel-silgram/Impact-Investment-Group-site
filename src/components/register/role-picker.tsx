/**
 * The ten tiles on /register.
 *
 * Same roles and same glyphs as the hero, drawn larger because here they are
 * the page rather than a strip under three photographs. R295-3 is explicit
 * that this page carries the heading, one line of lede and the tiles, and
 * nothing else: a second thing to look at on a chooser is a second thing to
 * hesitate over.
 *
 * The resident route has a centred, illuminated card of its own.
 *
 * WAVE 412: FRIENDLY TILES, NOT OUTLINES. These were translucent navy plates
 * with a hairline. They are now white cards with the site's rule and card
 * shadow, and they LIFT: 2px with the shadow deepening, on hover and on focus
 * alike. The focus arm is the point of the change rather than a bonus, because
 * a chooser that only answers to a mouse is a chooser that answers to half its
 * visitors, and this is the page a resident reaches.
