/**
 * The role glyph, drawn identically in the hero and on /register.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS MAP USED TO LIVE INSIDE hero.tsx. Wave 295 gave the wait list its
 * own picker page showing the same ten roles, and two copies of this map would
 * have drifted the first time anybody changed an icon: the hero would show a
 * landlord a house and the picker would show them something else, on two pages
 * one click apart. It is one map now, in one place.
 *
 * The treatment is the brand's: a 24px Lucide glyph, stroke 1.6, with EXACTLY
 * ONE detail element in the accent colour and never two. `accent` is that one
 * element; `baseOrange` is for the roles whose whole glyph is the accent (the
 * handshake), where there is nothing to pick out of it.
 *
 * WAVE 412 CHANGED WHAT IS BEHIND THE GLYPH, NOT THE GLYPH. It used to be a
 * 1.5px white hairline ring on navy; on a white page a white ring is nothing
 * at all, and a hairline ring is the coldest mark a light page can carry. It
 * is now a soft 12% orange disc, the same plate the human icons take
 * everywhere else on the site. The stroke follows the brand rule onto the new
 * ground: navy ink rather than white, with the one accent still orange.
 *
 * The accents are orange because every one of them is a person, a heart or a
 * hand. Teal belongs to data, and there is no data in a role tile.
