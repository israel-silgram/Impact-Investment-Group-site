 * Photographs arrive rather than pop.
 *
 * ── THE JOB ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This site's imagery is lamplight and golden hour on a white page, which is
 * the highest-contrast thing on most of these routes. An image that snaps in
 * at full strength the instant its last byte lands pulls the eye off whatever
 * the visitor was reading, and on a slow connection it does it several times
 * on the way down a page. 350ms of fade (`--duration-reveal`, the same token
 * the page's own reveal uses) turns that into something the eye notices and
 * then ignores, which is what it should be doing.
 *
 * ── WHY IT FADES TO THE IMAGE'S OWN OPACITY AND NOT TO 1 ──────────────────
 *
 * Four images on this site are decorative washes: the home hero's ground at
 * 7%, the partner page's hero visual at 20 and 32%, the platform portal art
 * at 25%, the partners hub band at 70%. Wave 413 shipped this as a keyframe
 * animation from opacity 0 to opacity 1, and a running animation outranks the
 * element's own opacity utility, so each of those ramped to FULL STRENGTH for
 * 350ms and then snapped back down. The rule in styles.css is a TRANSITION
 * now, whose target is whatever the element's own opacity already is, so a 7%
 * wash fades to 7% and stops. Nothing here darkens a page.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS ONE COMPONENT AND NOT A PROP ON FIFTY IMAGES ────────────────
 *
 * Because of the invariant. An `<img className="fade-in">` whose class carries
 * `opacity: 0` is the wave 412 defect with a different name: the prerendered
 * HTML would ship fifty invisible photographs and keep them invisible for good
 * without JavaScript. The rule from that wave is ANIMATE ONLY WHAT THIS CODE
 * ITSELF HID, and the only way to honour it here is to hide nothing in the
 * markup and let the client decide, per image, one frame before it fades it.
 *
 * So this walks the document once at mount, and again whenever the router adds
 * markup, and for each `<img>`:
 *
 *   ALREADY DECODED (`complete`, which covers every cached and every already
 *   painted image): nothing happens at all. No attribute, no animation, no
 *   frame at opacity 0. This is the common case on a second page view and it
 *   is the case that matters, because it is the one that could have blinked.
 *
 *   NOT YET DECODED: `data-img="pending"` hides it for as long as it has
 *   nothing to show anyway, and `load` or `error` moves it to `data-img="in"`,
 *   which releases it into the transition. `error` as well as `load` on
 *   purpose: a broken image must not be a permanently invisible one.
 *
 * Under reduced motion it does nothing whatsoever: no attribute is ever set,
 * so every photograph simply appears when it appears.
