/**
 * A continuous logo lane, restyled from the production site's
 * `CommissioningStrip`. The scroll behaviour is that component's, not an
 * approximation — see `.logo-marquee` in styles.css for the half-gap
 * correction the loop depends on, the hover/focus pause that WCAG 2.2.2
 * requires, and the reduced-motion fallback.
 *
 * The lane itself is aria-hidden decorative motion; the names ride alongside
 * as a real visually-hidden list, so assistive tech gets the content rather
 * than a wall of unreachable images.
 *
 * `plateClassName` exists because the two places this is used want different
 * plate geometry, not different behaviour: the council panel runs fixed-size
 * plates against pre-normalised artwork, where anything else would reintroduce
 * the ragged row the normalisation was done to fix.

            {/* ⚠ WAVE 490: `eager`, AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION IN
                REVERSE. Chrome decides `loading="lazy"` off an element's
                LAYOUT position and knows nothing about the transform that is
                moving it. This track is 3,082px wide at 390 inside a 390px
                window, so 32 of its 36 tiles are parked outside the viewport
                for ever: measured on 25 September 2026, 4 of 36 were ever
                requested at 390 and 8 of 41 images had decoded after three
                seconds of standing on the strip. What a phone showed was a
                row of empty white plates gliding past with a crest popping
                into one now and then.

                `fetchpriority="low"` is the other half: these are decoration,
                but decoration that has to be there, so they are fetched
                without competing with the hero photographs for the first
                screen. Eighteen distinct crests at 4.1KB each is 74KB, and
                the lane renders each of them twice against one URL, so the
                browser makes eighteen requests and not thirty-six.

                ⚠ WAVE 490b: AND THEY STAY `low`, WHICH WAS MEASURED BOTH WAYS.
                On a cold slow 4G load scrolled to the strip on the first frame
                its stylesheet applies (about 1.4s after navigation), 0 of the
                3 to 9 crests on screen have decoded 1.5s later, and they land
                at +2.25 to +3.25s. The first nine at `high` do decode inside
                the 1.5s, and Lighthouse mobile, five runs each, then puts the
                home page's LCP (the hero photograph) at 6,654ms against 6,353
                at `low`: 300ms of the first screen for everyone, bought for
                the visitor who scrolls 3,000px inside 1.4s. The trade goes to
                the first screen. Once the page has loaded, the crests on
                screen are decoded within 1.5s of the strip arriving; the cold
                case is a finding in docs/WAVE490_REPORT.md, item 1.

                AND THE PLATE IS THE SPAN, NOT THE IMAGE, which is what keeps
                this inside the `ImageFade` invariant. A tile that has not
                decoded shows the white plate and its hairline with nothing in
                it; the image fades in on top. Nothing is hidden in the markup
                and nothing waits at opacity 0 for JavaScript. */}
