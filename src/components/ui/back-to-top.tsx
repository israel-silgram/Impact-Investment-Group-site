/**
 * Back to top.
 *
 * ── THE JOB ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Several routes on this site are long: /platform, /legal and the ten partner
 * pages all run past four screens, and the navigation is at the top of all of
 * them. Without this, getting back to the menu from the foot of /legal is a
 * scroll of several seconds or a swipe the visitor has to keep repeating. One
 * press is the whole point.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT ALWAYS THERE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It appears after TWO viewports of scroll, and not before. A control that
 * says "back to top" while the top is still on the screen is one more thing in
 * the corner of every page, on every route, for no gain. Two viewports is the
 * point at which the header has been out of sight long enough to be missed.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT AN ELEMENT WAITING AT OPACITY 0 ─────────────────────────
 *
 * It is not rendered at all until it is wanted. The wave 412 invariant is that
 * nothing on this site is invisible without JavaScript, and the cheapest way
 * to keep it is for the markup not to carry the thing at all: the prerendered
 * HTML has no back-to-top button in it, so there is nothing to be stuck
 * hidden. The fade is an entrance on an element that did not exist a frame
 * ago, which is the only kind of entrance this wave allows.
 *
 * The fade OUT is why there are two pieces of state rather than one: the
 * element has to outlive the decision to remove it for as long as the exit
 * takes, or it would vanish rather than leave.

/**
 * ⚠ WAVE 490, PHONE RULE 3: THE CONTROL IS OFFERED FROM `lg` AND NOT BELOW IT,
 * AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE.
 *
 * Rule 3 says nothing floats over words: a fixed control's box may meet no
 * text node's box and no other control's box. On this site that is a statement
 * about ARITHMETIC, not about which corner the control is put in.
 *
 * At 390 the page's gutters are 20px and the content column is the other
 * 350px. A 44px circle placed against either gutter therefore covers 44 of
 * those 350px, which is an eighth of every line it lands on. Wave 414 put it
 * against the LEFT gutter, where it covered the first 44px of whatever line
 * was at the foot of the viewport, which is what the wave 490 brief measured
 * and what item 8 was raised about. Putting it back against the RIGHT gutter,
 * which this wave did first, moves it on to the ENDS of those lines instead:
 * measured over eleven routes after two viewports of scroll, 5 intersections
 * at 360, 10 at 390, 7 at 414, 2 at 667x375 and 1 at 768.
 *
 * There is no third position. A phone has no gutter wide enough to hold a
 * 44px target beside a full-width column, and 44px is rule 6's floor, so the
 * control cannot be made smaller either.
 *
 * At 1280 there is room and the same reading is **0 intersections on all ten
 * chromed routes**, which is why the control keeps the desktop unchanged. The
 * breakpoint is `lg`, the width at which the rest of this site switches to its
 * desktop composition: the demand map becomes pressable, the solutions rail
 * becomes a side rail, and the register journey's sticky bands stop sticking.
 *
 * NOT RENDERED rather than hidden with CSS, so there is no tab stop and no
 * markup for a phone to carry. A phone still has the browser's own way back to
 * the top; what it no longer has is a button sitting on the last line it was
 * reading. Section 9 of the report proposes what a phone control would need.
