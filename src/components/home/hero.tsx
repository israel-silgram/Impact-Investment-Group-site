 * HomeHero — the approved Mock-up 1 composition: three photographs captioned

 * buttons, no statistics, no scroll indicator. The role cards are the call to
 * action.
 *
 * The photographs lead and the words follow, and the whole section is built to
 * land inside the first screen — nothing here should need scrolling to. That
 * constraint drives the sizing: everything below the pictures is a fixed
 * stack, so the pictures take whatever height is left over and the band's
 * width follows from that rather than from the page's.

/**
 * One size for all three headlines, in `cqw` — a percentage of the panel,
 * whose width is the photograph's width. Sizing each line to fill its own
 * column instead makes the short one visibly larger than the other two, which
 * reads as a mistake rather than as alignment.
 *
 * So the size is set by the widest string and the other two centre under
 * their pictures. Derived from Barlow 800's own advance widths, read off
 * `@fontsource/barlow/files/barlow-latin-800-normal.woff2` at 1000 upem, plus
 * the -0.02em tracking that CSS applies after every character, the last one
 * included:
 *
 *   Providing Homes     7.554em − 15 × 0.02 = 7.254em  → spans 86% of its column
 *   Delivering Support  8.344em − 18 × 0.02 = 7.984em  → spans 95%
 *   Transforming Lives  8.753em − 18 × 0.02 = 8.393em  → the binding one, 100%
 *
 * 100 / 8.393 = 11.91, less 0.5% for sub-pixel rounding. This is the largest
 * common size that fits; anything above it overflows "Transforming Lives".
 * Barlow applies no kerning to any pair in these three strings — checked
 * against its GPOS table, all three total zero — so the fit is exact rather
 * than approximate.
 *
 * If the copy ever changes, re-measure the longest line. Do not nudge by eye.

 * All three are 1280×1024 — exactly the 5:4 the frames are set to, so

 *
 * 5:4 landscape is not a free choice. In the site's 1440px container the three

 * 5:4 is the tallest standard ratio that both fills the row and keeps the

 * height for the same width, which is why the band had to shrink away from the
 * page edges to fit.
