/**
 * MissionSolution — the need and the answer, as one bento grid with two faces.
 *
 * ── THE THREE THINGS THAT WERE WRONG WITH THE FIRST BENTO ─────────────────
 *
 * Callum: "colours look very dull… tons of gaps… still too much information."
 * All three were the same mistake in different clothes, and all three are
 * fixed by rules rather than by nudging:
 *
 * 1 · GAPS. Six stat tiles in a three-across grid is two rows with an empty
 *     sixth slot, and that tall right column stretched the orange hero into a
 *     mostly-empty rectangle. THE COUNT NOW DIVIDES THE ROW. Three stats, one
 *     row, no orphan — and the two columns come out close enough in height
 *     that nothing has to stretch to fill.
 *
 *     ⚠️ IF YOU ADD A FOURTH STAT, ADD A FIFTH AND A SIXTH TOO, or change the
 *     grid to four across. Anything that leaves a hole brings the gaps back.
 *
 * 2 · DULL. Everything on the cream face was a white card, so the only colour
 *     in a very large block was one orange rectangle. On cream the brand's
 *     teal only passes contrast as a DARK text colour, which reads muted — so
 *     brightness here cannot come from text. It comes from FILLS: the problem
 *     tile is navy, one stat tile is solid teal with white on it, the flip bar
 *     is an orange gradient. Four grounds in one grid instead of one.
 *
 * 3 · TOO MUCH. Six figures became three. Five bullets became three, and they
 *     moved INSIDE the problem tile rather than sitting in a box of their own —
 *     one fewer container, one fewer border, one fewer gap. The progress bars
 *     are gone: they compared a count of households against a sum of pounds,
 *     which was decoration pretending to be data.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE DROPPED FIGURES ARE NOT DELETED. `purposeStats` still holds all six in
 * content/home.ts; `SHOWN` below picks three by id. Swapping which three is a
 * one-line change and nothing else has to move.
 *
 * ── THE TWO FACES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both faces share one grid — same columns, same tile positions, same block
 * order: statement tile, three tiles, flip bar. Reading one face teaches you
 * the other. Only the ground and the content change.
 *
 * They are stacked in a single grid cell and crossfaded rather than rotated in
 * 3D: a 3D flip on a block this tall is heavy, and the cell takes the height of
 * the taller face so nothing jumps.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE GROUND TRAVELS WITH THE FACE, NOT THE SECTION. The front carries
 * `.section-light` and the back `bg-page`; the <section> is transparent. A
 * background on the section shows through the crossfade as a flash of the wrong
 * colour.

 * The hero figure, counting.
 *
 * `useCountUp` wants a number and the content gives a formatted string, so the
 * digits come out and are re-formatted on the way back — en-GB, because this is
 * a UK statistic and the separator must be a comma wherever the visitor is.
 * The static string stays in the accessibility tree: a screen reader should
 * hear "176,130", not a number ticking.
 *
 * WAVE 413: `tabular-nums`. Barlow's default figures are proportional, so a 1
 * is narrower than a 0 and the numeral changed WIDTH on nearly every frame of
 * the count: six digits jittering left and right for 1.4 seconds under a
 * headline. Tabular figures all occupy one advance width, so the number counts
 * up without moving. It is the whole reason the count is watchable.
