/**
 * A person on the team, on a cream card.
 *
 * Renders a real photograph when one is supplied, otherwise the person's
 * initials. Never a stock face — a placeholder head is worse than no head,
 * because a reader assumes it is them.
 *
 * ── Why every colour here is written out longhand ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The card is cream and sits on the cream About page. Every colour is stated
 * longhand rather than left to `.section-light`, because these cards also have
 * to survive being dropped on a navy section — the homepage may yet want them.
 * All of it is measured against the CREAM, which is the harsher of the two
 * grounds. From the contrast
 * table in CLAUDE.md, measured against #f7f1e6:
 *
 *   navy-900    16.8:1  ✓ names
 *   slate-ink    6.2:1  ✓ bio and credential lines
 *   teal-600     4.7:1  ✓ roles
 *   orange-700   4.1:1  ✗ for 14px text — large text only, 26px+
 *   orange-600   3.0:1  ✗
 *   orange-500   2.3:1  ✗ — icon glyphs and fills only
 *
 * So no role is set in orange, including Israel's. His seniority is carried by
 * things that are not text and therefore have no contrast floor: the card runs
 * full width, it takes a 4px orange left rule, and his portrait ring, icon and
 * credential markers are orange. Everyone else's are teal. That keeps the
 * hierarchy obvious and the accent legal at the same time.
 *
 * Four shapes, one component:
 *
 *   "portrait"  the tall card — 4:5 photograph at the top, name, role and
 *               credentials beneath. This is the one the About page uses for
 *               Israel, in the slot the AI meeting photograph used to hold.
 *   "row"       horizontal: square photo left, name / role / credential right.
 *               Two of these side by side fit the height of one "portrait",
 *               which is the whole reason the About section now balances.
 *   "lead"      the older full-width bar. Kept — /about no longer uses it, but
 *               it is the only shape that renders the bio inline.
 *   "member"    the older compact centred card.
 *
 * The hierarchy is size, width and accent. Nobody is shrunk to make the lead
 * look bigger, which is what makes it read as seniority rather than a ranking.
